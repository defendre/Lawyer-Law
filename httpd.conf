# #


# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.

# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's will be interpreted by the server as "/home/fahai/*.log".


# ## Section 1: Global Environment
# ServerType is either inetd, or standalone.  Inetd mode is only supported on
# Unix platforms.

ServerType standalone

# If your ServerType directive (set earlier in the 'Global Environment'
# section) is set to "inetd", the next few directives don't have any
# effect since their settings are defined by the inetd configuration.
# Skip ahead to the ServerAdmin directive.




# ## Section 2: 'Main' server configuration

# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.

# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.

# It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
# for a request.  If there are fewer than MinSpareServers, it creates
# a new spare.  If there are more than MaxSpareServers, some of the
# spares die off.  The default values are probably OK for most sites.

MinSpareServers 15

# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow

KeepAliveTimeout 9


# Limit on total number of servers running, i.e., limit on the number
# of clients who can simultaneously connect --- if this limit is ever

# It is intended mainly as a brake to keep a runaway server from taking
# the system with it as it spirals down...

MaxClients 60


# NOTE: This value does not include keepalive requests after the initial
# request per connection. For example, if a child process handles
# an initial request and 10 subsequent "keptalive" requests, it
# would only count as 1 request towards this limit.

# to redirect to local URL /missing.html
# ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl
# N.B.: You can redirect to a script or a document using server-side-includes.

# 3) external redirects
# ErrorDocument 402 http://some.other_server.com/subscription_info.html
# N.B.: Many of the environment variables associated with the original
# request will *not* be available to such a script.


# The following directives modify normal HTTP response behavior.
# The first directive disables keepalive for Netscape 2.x and browsers that
